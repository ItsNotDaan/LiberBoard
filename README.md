# LiberBoard Electronics Learning Platform

## Vision

Our vision is to bridge the gap in electronics learning and project creation by providing well-documented and easy-to-access information points. We aim to empower individuals and educational institutions with the necessary tools and resources to ignite creativity and facilitate a seamless learning experience.

## Development

LiberBoard Electronics Learning Platform is developed with the user in mind, ensuring a high degree of modularity and flexibility. The platform consists of two main LiBo PCBs and several add-on boards, each serving a unique purpose and adding a different dimension to the learning process.

### Main Boards

1. **LiBo DUO**: A budget-friendly, two-layer PCB with hand-solderable components.
2. **LiBo QUAD**: A medium-budget, four-layer PCB solderable using a heat plate or oven.

### Add-on Boards

1. **LiBo StarterBoard**: A board featuring a 16x2 LCD, 16 bit LEDs, an ADC sensor, and a temperature sensor.
2. **LiBo ArduinoBoard**: A board with an Arduino pinout, capable of communicating with Arduino Modules.
3. **LiBo DSPBoard**: An audio processing board with components for audio input/output, microphone, and speaker connectors.
4. **LiBo BaseBoard**: A programming stand/main board base station with easy access pinouts, BNC connectors, and status LEDs.

Each board is accompanied by exercises and code snippets to enable hands-on learning and practical understanding of electronics.

## Used Software and Products

All the LiBo PCB designs are created using the EDA software KiCad. The design files are open source and are available on GitHub, allowing users to recreate, modify, and order the PCBs. The platform also provides options for DIY PCB creation or ordering from the site.

## Conclusion

LiberBoard Electronics Learning Platform is a comprehensive solution for anyone looking to delve into the world of electronics. By providing well-documented, easy-to-use, and flexible resources, we hope to inspire a new generation of electronics enthusiasts and professionals.
